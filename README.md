program:ping command
client:
~~~
import socket 
from pythonping import ping
s = socket.socket()
s.bind(('localhost', 8000))
s.listen(5)
while True:
    c, addr = s.accept()
    print("Connection from", addr)
    try:
        hostname = c.recv(1024).decode().strip()
        if hostname:
            try:
                response = str(ping(hostname, verbose=False))
                c.send(response.encode())
            except Exception as e:
                c.send("Ping failed: {}".format(e).encode())
        else:
            c.send("Hostname not provided".encode())
    except Exception as e:
